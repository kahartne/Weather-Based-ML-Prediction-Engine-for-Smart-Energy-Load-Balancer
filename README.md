# Multi-Model Energy Demand Predictor

> This repository focuses on the ML Prediction Engine trained to generate a kWh prediction based on weather conditions (temperature, humidity, cloud_cover) and school activity (time_of_day, school_factor). This prediction can then be used for a variety of tasks, but is currently used as a baseline energy consumption metric for a college campus to reschedule classes and balance energy load.

Language(s) Used: Python

Models Trained & Tested: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Ensemble

Input: Real Weather Data and Synthesized kWh data [Utica_8-6_activity_training_kWH.csv]

Output: predicted_kWh [ml_baseline.csv]

See .ipynb file for original notebook formatting for generation of .pkl files. Also included is a .py file for testing and reproducibility.

kWh_Prediction_Generator/main.py is used to pull a .pkl model and output a kWh_baseline.csv file with the prediction results, given a weather.csv with weather data.

Note: fix_notebook.py only present for debugging purposes
See https://github.com/argomez2/CSC316_322_Project for utilization in Smart Energy Load Balancer
